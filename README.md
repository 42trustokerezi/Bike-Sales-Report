# Bike-Sales-Report (Interactive Dashboard using Ms Excel)
A Simple analysis of sales of Bikes with Data visualization for easy report.

## Objective
I was presented with a spreadsheet to analyze Bike sales based on metrics such as Customer Commute, customer Age Brackets and Average Price per Purchase.

## Dataset Used
<a href=https://github.com/42trustokerezi/Bike-Sales-Report/blob/main/Bike%20Sales.xlsx>Bike Sales Report</a>

## Key Performance Indicators (KPI)
•	What gender makes the most purchase?
•	How does commute distance influence bike purchase?
•	What age bracket buys the most bikes?

## Process
•	Removed duplicates to ensure accurate analysis.
•	Renamed cell contents in “Marital Status” and “Gender” columns for easy identification.
•	Created a new column, “Age brackets” to categorize customer Age into “Adolescent”, “Middle-aged”, and “Old”.
•	Created pivot tables to analyze data according to KPI.
•	Developed Dashboard using charts generated from the pivot tables.
•	Applied Slicers to make charts dynamic.
